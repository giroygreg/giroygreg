# 👋 Hi, I’m @giroygreg

- 👀 I’m interested in staying under the radar, climbing the corporate ladder (without causing too much trouble), and figuring out how to be a part of the Roy family dynasty.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ropes of corporate politics, the art of covering my tracks, and maybe a bit of legalese—just in case.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that won't get me in trouble with the Roys or put me in the crossfire. If it looks safe, count me in!
- 📫 How to reach me: You can probably find me somewhere in Waystar Royco's HR department or trying to avoid Tom. Send me a DM if it’s really important—or maybe just email, I guess.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once threw up in a mascot suit at a company amusement park. It was a rough day.
